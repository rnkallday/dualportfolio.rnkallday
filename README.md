# dualportfolio.rnkallday

## Project Overview
A dual-portfolio website with a GSAP-powered hero landing page that splits visitors into two sections:
1. Creative Work
2. AI Work

Each section uses GSAP animations for content navigation, with both horizontal and vertical scrolling sections.

## Completed Improvements

### HTML Structure Fixes
- Fixed invalid HTML structure by removing nested `<h1>` inside `<p>` tags
- Converted second-level headings to `<h2>` tags for proper semantic structure
- Added missing navigation menu to the AI section
- Removed stray closing `</ul>` tag
- Ensured proper tag nesting and structure

### CSS Improvements
- Added styles for `<h2>` tags to match the design
- Added vendor prefixes for better cross-browser compatibility:
  - Added `-webkit-mask-image` alongside `mask-image` for better browser support
- Fixed empty rulesets in CSS
- Added proper height to HTML element
- Set position property for horizontal container for GSAP
- Ensured consistent styling between Creative and AI sections

### JavaScript Fixes

- Updated deprecated jQuery `$(window).load()` function to the modern `$(window).on('load', ...)` syntax
- Improved GSAP initialization code:
  - Added proper error handling to check if GSAP and ScrollTrigger are loaded
  - Wrapped GSAP code in document ready function to ensure DOM is loaded
  - Enhanced ScrollTrigger configuration for more reliable horizontal scrolling
  - Added error logging for better debugging

## Current Structure
- Hero section with split-screen UI (Creative/AI toggle)
- Multiple vertical content sections
- Horizontal scrolling container with panels
- Proper script loading order:
  - jQuery
  - GSAP
  - ScrollTrigger
  - Custom scripts

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- jQuery 3.6.0
- GSAP 3.12.2
- ScrollTrigger plugin

## Next Steps
1. Test all GSAP animations to ensure they're working correctly
2. Add actual portfolio content to each section
3. Further optimize for mobile devices
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages
5. Consider adding more interactive elements
6. Optimize loading performance

## Development Notes
- The site uses GSAP for all animations
- The hero section toggles between Creative and AI modes on click
- Horizontal scrolling is triggered by vertical scroll in the designated section
- All jQuery, GSAP, and ScrollTrigger libraries are loaded via CDN
